Turn unique values in dataframe columns into index
I have a large dataset consisting of multiple columns but only two types of data. The first column is a value and the other (50+) columns are string data.

The value is a characteristic of each of the string data. Now I want to use the string data as index to gather all the values correlating to each string. Is there an easy way to do this in Python? I am quite new to programming and have no clue how to tackle this problem.
